        Teams gathers before the festivals by 3 days so they can train together.
        All village gathers together and they make a draw to matchup team members.

Beggining of the Story (before the festival by 3 days):
    Starting in Userkaf home
        Userkaf is eating his breakfast [] alone.
        His mom is sewing some clothes for the festival.
        His dad gathered with other village adults to prepare the draw ceremony. 
        Userkaf was very nervous as it's his first time sharing in this competition, he always wanted to, but he hasn't the bravery to share, but now he will whatever the cost.

    All people gathering in the square of []
        This was the only thing made before the official festival days.
        They started to list all who were sharing.
        There were aere about 44 participant making 11 teams.
        Their age was ranged between 17 and 18.

        Userkaf team:
            after drawing 3 teams, the next team leader came and it was HIM.
            Next participant was Minas, a tuff boy.
            Next was a quiet girl called Tausret.
            And the last was the most famous girl in the village Eya.

        All teams were organied and chosen their leader.
        Each team started to go from the square and each one went for his job or whatever.

    Under Sun rays:
        They were standing together under ASWAN SUN.
        They decide to go under the a palm tree beside the Nile.
        They start to see each other clearly
            Minas was had a dark skin, and was muscular.
            Tausret was short wheat-colored with a brown hear.
            Userkaf wasn't as muscular as Minas, but he had a strog appeal with his wheat-colored skin.
            Finally the village princess, Eya, with her modest clothes, and snowy skin, and her hazel eyes, covering her hair with a soft silk pieces.
            They were just looking at each other.
        # And these small moments witnessed the birth of something big!
        Each one says his advantages and abilities
        Userkaf is known for his promptitude
        Minas is known for his strong arms
        Eya is known for her agility
        Tausret is known for her patience

        Everyone was tired of the day so they decided to meet the next day in the same place

Before the festival by 2 days:
    Meeting for the second time:
        It was a coincidence that all of them was the first time sharing in this competition so they didn't know how to prepare or what should be done before
        They decide to separte and ask another participants if they have participated before
        Eya says that she knows a boy called Intef that particpated before
        Userkaf has a strange feeling, he doesn't know what is this but he decides to skip 
        They go and meet Intaf he tells them about it, he lives in a very far place in the village so they take time going to him
            In the way:
                All of them exchange words together
                Everyone speaks about his dreams and past experiences in life
                Userkaf feels the same weird feeling when Eya speaks with Minas, he sees that she gives him more attention than him

            Arrival:
                He was 19 years old, so he wouldn't sharing in this year
                He told them that games goes like that

                he told them that every year competition has a MORAL
            They thank him and go

            Back (before sunset):
                Eya and Tausret walks together to home since they almost live near each other while each of Minas and Userkaf walk alone

    Sunset:
        Userkaf sits on a rock beside the Nile and looking at the sun setting
        He speaks to himself 
            WHAT AM I FEELING?
            DID I FALL IN LOVE?
            how ME love HER?
            Does she even know IM ALIVE?
            SHE'S THE MOST KNOWN GIRL IN THE VILLAGE, EVERYONE KNOWS HER, WHY WOULD SHE CHOOSE ME ON THEM?
        He decides to forget her and focus on the festival

Before the festival by 1 day:
    They meet for the last time before the festival (in same place):
        Userkaf has known Senet and Mehen for long time, he always played them with his father, he starts to teach them some tactics and strategies
        Minas started to teach them some fighting techniques
        Eya focused on teaching them resistance exercises, although it's just one day, but it won't harm anyways
        Tausret tried to motivate them and keep the spirit and remove any stress and anxiety
        Minas seemed non caring but he caed inside
        Eya was very nervous and Tausret was trying to calm her down
        Userkaf was in another dimension, thinking of Eya and the competition, trying to focus on it, but he was struggling with that,
        Eya intterputs his thoughts and tell him let's go LEADER
        Userkaf thinking of giving Eya the lead since she previously mentioned that she was sad of not being the leader, and thought that would be very cute thing to represent his love to her
        He decides that with Minas, he seems uncaring of whom is the leader
        Userkaf tells them that Eya will be the leader, and Eya is very happy with that and thanks him too much
        He couldn't resist her beautiful smile
        Now they started planning who plays what when
            the games was
                1st day, Archery Contests,  Wrestling, Stick Fighting              
                2nd day, Senet, Mehen, Hounds and Jackals    
                3rd day, Running, Boat Racing
            Each game is played by one on the first 2 days, the third day all of them play
            The leader doesn't play these game so they decided
                Tausret will play Archery and Mehen
                Minas will place Wrestling and Hounds and Jackals
                Userkaf will play Senet and Stick fighting 
        Eya wanted to do something special for the team, she said each one think of a symbol, and then grabbed some four pieces of papyrus and drew all of them on each of them and then gave each one one, just for memory
        now all done, all go home

    Userkaf home:
        He contemplating the paper since it was made by EYA herself, the he puts it under the pillow then sleeps

1st day of the festival:
    The Dream:
        Square of [], all are gathered for the start of competition, the team meet up and stand together, they excite eachother
        Organizers tells Eya to divide themselves to two teams, she chooses Minas with her and Userkaf wit Tausret, Userkaf feels JEALOUS, like HUH? why him? then he doesn't say anything
        They didn't know what are teams for
        All teams walked together to a point beside the Nile, the Nile didn't have water
        Userkaf sees a temple and suggests to explore it, Tausret says why not
        Both of them walk to it, it was very near
        Eya and Minas see them and come after them trying to catch them before they enter
        Userkaf and Tausert enter the temple then look behind seeing Minas and Eya running after them saying NOOO
        the door closes on them, the place becomes very dark, they can barely see becuase there are some small sun rays entering from the holes of the place
        Eya shouts at Userkaf that he entered a wrong place
        He says I didn't know 
        All 3 tells him you are the reason of our loss in the competition
        He gets angry, Minas then tries to hit him but he defends himself and fight him back, he pushes him hard so he hit Eya and she falled on ground hard, Minas pushes him harder and he falls on the ground too, Tausert goes for Eya to get her up, Userkaf kicks Minas too hard hitting a stone column that falls on Eya and Tausert killing them, Minas shouts you killed them, and Userkaf shouts 
        The door opens and it was his mom waking him up
    
    Morning:
        His mother asks him what did he dream of, he tells her nothing and she completes her sleeping
        Userkaf looks in the window to check the time, he found it before sun rise
        He was so nervous of the dream, he went out from home
        He went to a spot near the Nile, it had water normally (not like the dream)
        He was very afraid of being the reason of their loss
        He sat on a rock, looked at the sky and prayed God to win
        Now only the win but he prayed for Eya
        He cried of praying, he kept so much inside himself
        He wasn't used to cry specially on site of someone, he was alone and praying so yeah
        There was still time for the competition, he slept on himself on that rock
        
        He waked up on a gentle soft cute voice saying Userkaf, that was the first time of her saying his name, it rang in his ears giving him large dose of dopamine
        He woke up and stood with her, he then saw Minas and Tausert behind Eya
        He cheered them, he was getting to hate Minas, they were friends since a long time, A GIRL SPLITS THEM??
        They walked together together to the square of []

    Beggining of the festival:
        All people of the village was gathered, lots of drinks and food
        The first show was some kids standing on the stage singing a national song
        Userkaf got some food since he was starving and brings some for Eya and sits beside her, the later Minas and Tausert come
        After couple of shows, the waited moment has come, now the elders of the village came to announce the competition start and rules
        They mention that the competition will go for 5 days, no one was expecting that,since each year it's for 3 days only
        They thought of different thoughts, the games will decreases on each day? or games will increase to be enought, no one knew the truth
        Voices became loud so they said that everyday will be revealed alone
        Today game will be only running, for heating up, they were nervous of that surprise
            A start line, an end line, a player of each team starts with a flag, gives it to the next player, well known rules
            Eya chose Minas to start then Tausert then Userkaf then here 
            Minas starts the race, he was kinds slow, and other runners precede him, he played smartly, when Tausert was on his sight, he shouted and threw the high in the air to her, she ran and jumped to catch it and she succeeded
            She continues on running, she got a good place among runners
            Userkaf while standing, he sees a temple beside the trees, it reminds it of the dream, but Tausert refuses that and get him out of thinking shouting with his name and catching his focus, he gets the flag and flaw away
            He was running very fast, he wanted to see Eya more than to give her the flag, he caught her on his sight making him faster, he handled it to her saying good luck
            Eya runs away with the flag [getting the first place]
            
        They announce the winner of the race, and the only elminated team so they become 10 and complete another shows
        Our guys decide to walk together to think of what coming 
        they know that all they planned to is useless since they completly changed the rules, so they decide to go home and see each other next day

    Before sunset:
        He had many feelings he couldn't keep in himself, he brought a paper and wrote a long love message for her, but he cuts it and throw it, he brings another one and simply write one sentence, you make me think long
    
    After sunset:
        He goes with the paper and throws it in Eya's home yard then go away very fast
    
    Night:
        he went home and went to beside


2nd day of the festival:
    Home:
        Dream:
            He dreams of marrying her
        He wakes up full of dopamine 
        He starts his day as usual

    They meet before the second day starts:
        They wanted to get ready but as the first day wasn't as expected, so they can't expect what's happening

    Start of the day:
        They declare the days' games which are Senet and Archery
        They tell them to divie themselves to 2 teams
        Our team draws randomly to be fair, Eya comes with Userkaf and Minas comes with Tausert
        Each team of the two play one game of the two games, so Eya and Userkaf play senet and the others play go for Archery
        Userkaf felt so happy with that, it's the chance of growing the bond between them
        They talk a little before their turn
        Each of them plays against another one but they can see each other
        At total each team of the 10 plays 4 games, each win gives one point

    End of the day:
        They collect the points of the teams elimnate the least 2 teams so they become 8

    After the festival:
        They all walk together for some time, Minas goes home alone as usual, Tausert sees a friend so she walks with her, leaving Userkaf and Eya together
        They chat a little, she mentions the paper that was thrown at her yard yesterday
        They walk to much that they reached her home, he cheered her and left
        He was feeling that she is one, she is his soulmate, she is the one who completes him
